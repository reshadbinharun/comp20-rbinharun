1. I learned how the web works, and that APIs can be used to build server-side and client-side code. I also learned how to use resources online and my classmates to implement my code.
2. My favorite assignment was assignment 2, since I learned how versatile using APIs could be.
3. I have grown from a BME kid who took one coding class freshmen year to a senior (still BME) who feels that he is at least equipped to learn to build websites on my own.
4. Two most important things:
	a. I learned how to use APIs e.g. including google maps API for assignment 2
	b. I learned how to create a web server e.g. using node.js to deploy my server-side application for taking user input to heroku
5. I would want to delve deeper into learning to use different APIs.
