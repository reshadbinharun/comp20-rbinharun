	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>My partner wrote the serve-side code for determining locations of landmarks and fellow Tufts students within a 1 mi radius based on client-side application posting information such as latitude, longitude, and login. The data was then to be stored on a database for the server-side code to access and process. As the security contractor I am tasked with finding vulnerabilities with the server-side code by hacking my partner's code.</p>
		<h1>Methodology</h1>
